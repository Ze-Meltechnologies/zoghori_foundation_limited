        <p><b> <span>Zoghori Foundation is the vehicle for Zoghori Sacco Society Ltd for Corporate Social Responsibility.</span></b></p>
        <p> The current flagship project of the Foundation is an education <span>SCHOLARSHIP SCHEME</span> for bright but less fortunate children <br>
            who are facing difficulties in paying school fees for both secondary and  university  education.</p>
        <p> Zoghori Foundation was established in 2019 as a registered trust in recognition of the <br>
            need to enhance the existing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives by the society</p>
        <p>At that point, the society felt it was its duty to not only grow <br>
            financially but also develop a deeper commitment to help enhance the growth of the community</p>
        <p>We believe that our role goes beyond profit-making to include promoting
            the long-term economic <br> prosperity and quality of life for everyone in our communities</p>
        <p>If our people prosper, we prosper as a society and soar to unimaginable
            heights of achieving our motto <br>  of <span><q>BUILDING ONE ANOTHER </q></span></p>
        <p>In the year 2016, Zoghori Sacco Society Limited successfully rolled out
            an  Education program to pay <br>
            school fees for needy secondary school students as an integral part of its CSR projects</p>
        <p>The program will continue in the days ahead, to enable these children to
            achieve  their full potential</p>
